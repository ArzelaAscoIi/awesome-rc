## Design 

* [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.de/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) - a cloud-based 3D modeling, CAD, CAM, and PCB software platform for product design and manufacturing. It provides a free non-commercial license.
* [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/de/software/ultimaker-cura) - slicer for Ender pro 3d printer

## Hardware 

### Controller
* [Navio2](https://navio2.emlid.com/) - Autopilot HAT for Raspberry Pi running ArduPilot and ROS.
* [Mateksys](http://www.mateksys.com/?page_id=7637) - Ardupilot compatible flight controllers

## Software 

### Protocols and tools 
* [MAVLink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAVLink) - MAVLink or Micro Air Vehicle Link is a protocol for communicating with small unmanned vehicle. It is designed as a header-only message marshaling library. 
* [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) -  a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project. And it's all open source.
* [OpenTX](https://www.open-tx.org/) - open source firmware for RC radio transmitters
* [ExpressLRS](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS) - an open source Radio Link for Radio Control applications

### Groundstation and Simulation

* [Mission planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/) - software to control ardupilot, including tracking, planning and configuration remotely 
* [QGroundControl][http://qgroundcontrol.com/] - Intuitive and Powerful Ground Control Station for the MAVLink protocol.
* [Open Rocket](https://openrocket.info/) - Plan, simulate and fly rockets

### Vehicle 
* [Ardupilot](https://ardupilot.org/) - open source autopilot system supporting many vehicle types.

## Youtube Channels

* [RCTestflight](https://www.youtube.com/c/rctestflight) - Experimental (autonomous) vehicles
* [ProjectAir](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProjectAirAviation) - Experimental vehicles (sometimes rocket powered...)
* [RcLifeOn](https://www.youtube.com/c/RcLifeOn) - Large scale projects 
* [Flitetest](https://www.youtube.com/c/FlitetestHQ) - RC channel that focuses more on models and fun projects than on engineering.
* [BPS Space](https://www.youtube.com/c/BPSspace) - Nice rocket projects
* [Stuff made here](https://www.youtube.com/c/StuffMadeHere) - not really RC, but nice engineering channel
## Documentation

* [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) - Simple docs tool, written in react to document your projects.
